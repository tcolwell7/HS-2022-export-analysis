# HS-2022-export-analysis

## Background 

In the process or learning python using Juypter notebooks I am transitioning to producing work in this medium, opposed to R or excel. This project is my first to deliver outputs to progress a specific workstream for stakeholders using Python. 

## Context

International goods trade is recorded using the Harmonised System (HS) of recording goods. Unique 2-6 digits are used to identify specific products. In-doing so this allows for a consistent measuring system which helps facilitate monitoring and compiling statistics for international trade world-wide. 

This HS system at the 6-digit level is chnaged every 5 years, the latest chnage occuring in 2022. 

This causes chnages to reference and legal documents to ensure the goods nomenclature (goods codes) is upto date with the most upto date. 

## Purpose of analysis

At the World Trade Organisation member states have their tariff schedules (i.e. documents containing all goods code and associated tariffs) which require updating to HS-2022 nomenclature. 

To help understand how these chnages may effect UK-trade a review is required of countries tariff schedules. If a highly traded good's code has changed to an updated tariff - this may incur extra tariff costs for example. 

Having identified which 8-digit goods codes which are effected by the HS-2022 changes, to help indentify the member states and top exported goods, a full UK-export analysis is required. This will help stakeholders more efficently review of tariff-schedules at the WTO.
